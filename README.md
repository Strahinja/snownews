Snownews Readme
===============

Snownews is released under the conditions of the GNU General Public License
version 2. If you don't know what this is (which I doubt) read the file COPYING
included with this program package.


System requirements and installation:
-------------------------------------

Linux or any other Unix. Mac OS X will do as well.
The ncurses library version 5.0 or higher. Some ancient curses might also work.
libxml2. Will work with any version of it.

If your system meets the requirements you can install snownews by typing:

./configure
make
su/sudo to root
make install


How does it work:
-----------------

The program comes with a wonderful documentation named manpage. Everything is
explained there so I save this space and don't repeat everything again.

'man snownews' is available in English, German, Dutch and French at the moment.


Localization:
-------------

If you want to have snownews in another language and know how to do it, get
in touch with me. If you don't know how translating programs using gettext
works, but want to translate it anyway, get in touch with me, too. ;)
