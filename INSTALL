Install ncurses > 5.0
Install libxml2

./configure
make
(root) make install


The configure does not use autotools. If compiling fails on a platform the
script already knows, please let me know. If you have an unknown platform
and you can get it to compile, please send me your 'uname' output and the
CFLAGS and LDFLAGS you needed.

For opml2snow to work you also need the Perl module XML::LibXML installed.
As root start "perl -MCPAN -e shell" and type "install XML::LibXML". That
should be the most convenient way to install it.
